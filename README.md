# Flower_detection

The main purpose of this repository is to provide a useful framework for models training on provided Google Colab notebooks only. 

## Model training
Two Colab notebooks, namely ```Object_detection_FRCNN.ipynb``` and ```Object_detection_YOLO.ipynb``` enable training of some popular object detection neural networks:
- Faster RCNN (PyTorch)
- YOLO (Ultralytics)
- Mask RCNN (PyTorch)
